            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p class="original">Eskişehir Technical University, or ESTÜ for short (English: Eskişehir Technical University), is a public university in
            Turkey. It started providing education in Eskişehir on May 18, 2018, with five faculties, three institutes, and two
            vocational schools on two different campuses, through the transfer of various educational units belonging to Anadolu
            University.[1] As of 2019, the university continues its educational activities with 1,317 personnel and approximately
            14,000 students.[2]</p>
            <span class="dots">...</span>
            <p class="extra">Thanks to the Hasan Polatkan Airport it contains, it is one of the largest universities in Turkey. The university has
            the world's first licensed university airport with its operating license in 2007.[2]
            
            The only center in Turkey where seismic isolators can be tested is at ESTU. ESTU Seismic Isolator Center is also one of
            the top 5 centers in the world. ESTU is one of the rare universities that offer pilot training, and the piloting program
            is among the departments that accept students with the highest score.</p>
