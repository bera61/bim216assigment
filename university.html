                <p class="original">Eskişehir Technical University, or ESTÜ for short (English: Eskişehir Technical University), is a public university in
                Turkey. It started providing education in Eskişehir on May 18, 2018, with five faculties, three institutes, and two
                vocational schools on two different campuses, through the transfer of various educational units belonging to Anadolu
                University.[1] As of 2019, the university continues its educational activities with 1,317 personnel and approximately
                14,000 students.[2]</p>
                <div class="extra">
                    <p>Thanks to the Hasan Polatkan Airport it contains, it is one of the largest universities in Turkey. The university has
                    the world's first licensed university airport with its operating license in 2007.[2]
                    
                    The only center in Turkey where seismic isolators can be tested is at ESTU. ESTU Seismic Isolator Center is also one of
                    the top 5 centers in the world. ESTU is one of the rare universities that offer pilot training, and the piloting program
